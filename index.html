                <h6>6. Support</h6>

                <h4 class="mt-3">Q. In how many days I can learn Bootstrap completely?</h4>
                <p class="text-justify">How long it takes depends on how much you know. There is no such thing as
                    "complete knowledge" of programming languages, since they're not dead: the languages are always
                    undergoing changes, and there are always new tricks or new best practices to learn.
                    <br /><br />
                    But that said, are you familiar with LESS? How about CSS responsive grids? (Can you make one
                    yourself from scratch?) Media queries? Do you have a basic grasp of JQuery? (Knowing how to work
                    with Grunt helps too). If so, then learning bootstrap should take about a day (or a few hours).
                    Otherwise, it could take 1-2 weeks or a month working with it and experimenting, depending on your
                    prior knowledge.
                    <br /><br />
                    Getting up and running with LESS should take a few hours, as its pretty easy to understand if you
                    know CSS. I'd also recommend looking up some tutorials on making a responsive grid in pure CSS so
                    that you can better understand how grids work. JQuery is also pretty easy to get started with if you
                    know Javascript; I'd say give it about a week or so to get familiar with JQuery (including Ajax,
                    animations, etc). If you don't know Grunt (and don't want to learn it), then you can check out
                    Codekit for compiling your LESS and Javascript files. I would really recommend using Grunt for
                    compilation, though, since its pretty powerful and versatile---as well as completely free.</p>
